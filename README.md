**Discription**: 

This project aims to develop and evaluate a Decision Tree model using the Scikit-learn library in Python. Decision Trees are a popular machine learning algorithm known for their interpretability. 1  They create a series of if-else rules to classify or predict outcomes based on input data. 2  In this project, we will select a suitable dataset for classification or prediction tasks. The chosen dataset will be preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split into training and testing sets. Subsequently, a Decision Tree model will be trained on the training data. Key hyperparameters of the model will be explored and potentially tuned to optimize performance. Once trained, the model will be used to make predictions on the unseen test data. The accuracy and other relevant performance metrics will be evaluated to assess the model's effectiveness. Finally, the trained Decision Tree model will be visualized using appropriate tools to gain insights into its decision-making process. This visualization will help understand the model's logic and identify important features influencing the predictions. 3  The project will culminate in a comprehensive report documenting the entire process, including data exploration, model building, evaluation, and visualization.
